# drugBankDrugMap
<p>drugBankADrugMap is a simple parser program that generates mappings from drug brand names to drug generic names as documented by DrugBank.</p>
<p>DrugBank raw data has been excluded for storage purposes, but all data is available at <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/.">DrugBank</a></p>
<p><em>Note: the drugMapping.csv file generated by drugBankDrugMap is preferred over that of openFDADrugMap as DrugBank's dataset is
is more comprehensive and complete</em></p>
